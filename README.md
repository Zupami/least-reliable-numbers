# least-reliable-numbers

When checking the numbers 3 to 9999, these are the most common liars (with frequency in brackets):
256 (53)
16 (36)
4096 (33)
1296 (29)
64 (28)
729 (27)
529 (23)
1568 (23)
1024 (22)
1207 (22)

It seems that powers of 2 are less trustworthy than other numbers.

256 is lying about the following numbers:
341, 435, 451, 561, 595, 645, 703, 1105, 1247, 1271, 1387, 1581, 1687, 1695, 1729, 1891, 1905, 2047, 2071, 2091, 2431, 2465, 2701, 2821, 3133, 3277, 3367, 3655, 3683, 4033, 4371, 4681, 4795, 4859, 5083, 5151, 5461, 5551, 6601, 6643, 7471, 7735, 7957, 8119, 8227, 8321, 8695, 8911, 9061, 9131, 9211, 9605 and 9919

Can't really spot a pattern here, 256 seems very erratic.
